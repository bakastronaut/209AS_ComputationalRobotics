Initial list of truths to be assumed throughout project. We can discuss these and make changes.

--------------Wrapper Code--------------

Base units: metric (allows us to avoid the slugs vs. pounds mass fuster cluck involved with English units).

We'll keep track of the pure state space at this level so we can do animations and plots with global knowledge. This info wil be used to create the MDP state space.

Pure state space:
C = {x, y, x', y'} (2-D position, 2-D velocity) where primed variable is 1st derivative
	for x in {-2,-1,0,1,2} (left shoulder, left lane, straddling, right lane, right shoulder)

-------------MDP--------------

MDP state space:
S = {d_front, d_right, d_back, d_left, d'_front, d'_right, d'_back, d'_left, eta}
	d represents the greek letter delta
	eta captures speed (function of current speed, preferred speed, and speed limit)

A = {accelerate, lane change}
	Permissible acceleration values = {TBD}
	Permissible lane change values = {TBD}

Reward function:
R(state) = TBD

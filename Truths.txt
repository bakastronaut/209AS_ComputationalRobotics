Initial list of potential truths to be assumed throughout project:

Base units: metric (allows us to avoid the slugs vs. pounds mass fuster cluck involved with English units).

Pure state space:
S = {x, y, x', y'} (2-D position, 2-D velocity) where primed variable is 1st derivative
	for x in {-2,-1,0,1,2} (left shoulder, left lane, straddling, right lane, right shoulder)

Working state space:
S' = {d_front, d_right, d_back, d_left, d'_front, d'_right, d'_back, d'_left, eta}
	d represents delta
	eta captures speed (function of current speed, preferred speed, and speed limit)

A = {accelerate, lane change}
	Permissible acceleration values = {TBD}
	Permissible lane change values = {TBD}

Reward function, R(state) = TBD
